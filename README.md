# excel-grading
Macros, scripts, and sundry for those using Excel to do grading in courses
As a teacher at Reykjav√≠k University, I find myself using Microsoft Excel often to give detailed feedback to students about their assignments.
To keep myself sane and eliminate repetitive tasks, I developed VBA code and scripts to make this easier.
Enjoy!
